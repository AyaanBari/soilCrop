        "NAME": "Jute",
        "TYPE": "Fiber",
        "DESCRIPTION": "Jute is one of the most affordable natural fibers and is second only to cotton in terms of production and variety of uses. It is known as the 'Golden Fiber' due to its color and high cash value. Jute is mainly grown in the Ganges delta region of India and Bangladesh.",
        "DISEASES": "The crop is susceptible to diseases like stem rot, black band, and soft rot. Proper crop rotation and the use of disease-resistant varieties can help control these diseases.",
        "COMPANION": "Jute can be intercropped with crops like rice, maize, and vegetables during its early growth stages.",
        "PESTS": "Major pests include jute hairy caterpillar, stem weevil, and semilooper. Spraying with appropriate insecticides and maintaining field hygiene can help control these pests.",
        "FERTILIZER": "Jute requires a balanced application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. A typical recommendation is 40-50 kg N, 20-25 kg P2O5, and 20-25 kg K2O per hectare. Organic manures like compost or farmyard manure can also be applied.",
        "TIPS": "Ensure proper retting of jute stalks for high-quality fiber. Retting is the process of extracting fibers by soaking the stalks in water.",
        "SPACING": "The recommended spacing for jute is 25-30 cm between rows and 5-10 cm between plants within a row.",
        "WATERING": "Jute requires adequate moisture during its growth period. Irrigation is necessary during dry spells, especially at the seedling stage and during flowering.",
        "STORAGE": "Jute fibers should be dried properly before storage to prevent fungal growth. Store in a cool, dry place to maintain fiber quality."
